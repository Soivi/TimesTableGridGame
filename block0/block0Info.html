      Practice level allows you to train your multiplications without a time limit. On difficulty levels easy, medium,
      hard and very hard the time is running. However, in order to proceed to the next level, you must pass your current
      level within 40 seconds. On the impossible level you are faced with a 40-second time limit, within which you must
      pass or else you will fail.
